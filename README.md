# elicitatoR: Aggregation of Distributions from Expert Elicitation

`elicitatoR` is a package designed to aggregate expert elicitations into a single *wisdom of the crowd* distribution. At present, `elicitatoR` is set to combine elicitations resulting from the **IDEA** protocol (Hanea et al., 2016).

**NOTE**: this package is under constant development; methods *will* change.

## Package goal

The goal of this package is to eventually provide an online interface to collecting expert opinions, fitting distributions to the elicited data and providing feedback in the form of fitted probability distributions and standardised percentiles.
